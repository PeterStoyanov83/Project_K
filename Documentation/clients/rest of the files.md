# Project K - Django App Files

## `__init__.py`

This is an empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.

## `tests.py`

This file defines the tests for your app. Each test is a function that checks a specific part of your app.

## `signals.py`

This file defines the signals for your app. Signals allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers when certain
actions have taken place.

## `management/commands/`

This directory contains custom management commands for your app. You can run these commands from the command line
with `python manage.py commandname`.

## `migrations/`

This directory contains database migrations for your app. Migrations are how Django stores changes to your models (and
thus your database schema).
